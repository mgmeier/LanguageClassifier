LanguageClassifier
==================

Language Classification based on [Bigram Model Similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram).

This program lets you train different language models from
text data and save them as binary '.lmod' files. You can
then evaluate the similarity of further text or file input
to these models, and let the program guess the input language.

A simple read-eval-print loop (REPL) is included to toy around with.

This program just shows how it's done in Haskell and is published for its (hopefully) educational value.
